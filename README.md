# BirthdayApp

Despriction to the interface component: 
    The interface component I have implemented here is a button that can be used to navigate between two pages. I have also created an icon for my application.
    1. The home page of my application consists of a "Start" button.
    2. Clicking the Start button will help us to navigate from the home page to main activity page.
    3. I have included four more buttons on this page which will be further used for developing the app.
